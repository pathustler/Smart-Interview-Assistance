0,How do you stay motivated during repetitive tasks?,"Well, you know, repetitive tasks, they're just...there. You gotta do them, right? I try to just, like, get them over with. Honestly, sometimes I zone out a bit. It's not ideal, I know, but it helps. I listen to music, usually something upbeat, to keep me from falling asleep.

And coffee! Lots of coffee. Gotta keep that caffeine flowing, haha! Sometimes, I just tell myself it's temporary, you know? Just a little blip on the radar. I think about the bigger picture, maybe, like the end result. Or I just daydream.

Honestly, I haven't really figured out the perfect system yet. I kinda wing it. I'm a pretty adaptable person though, so I manage. Hopefully, the task doesn't last too long. And if it does, well, I just push through.",0.0
1,What skills do you hope to develop in your next role?,"Well, that's a great question! Honestly, I haven't really given it too much thought, you know?

Time management is important, so yeah, I'd like to improve that. 

And, um, maybe get better at, like, the stuff they need me to do? Whatever the specifics are of the job, I'll learn it, I guess. Collaboration is good too, right? So, I hope to improve my teamwork skills. Oh, and I hope to be challenged, but not like *too* challenged. Something that's just right. Basically, I'm open to everything and anything. I’m a fast learner, I think!",0.0

I guess, like, it depends on the project. If it's, like, something really hard, teamwork is good, cause other people can help out, you know? If it's something easy, I'm fine doing it myself. 

I don't really have a strong preference, to be honest. It just depends. Both are fine, I guess. Teamwork can be fun, with the right people, you know? And working alone is chill. Yeah, both are good. Whatever works, really. Just whatever needs to be done, you know?",0.0

But, more than that, I do enjoy... the people. Sometimes. And sometimes I actually feel like I'm making a difference, you know? Like, contributing something. Even if it's just, you know, a small something.

I also like the... the potential. There's, like, always room to grow, and maybe one day I'll actually be *really* good at it. So, yeah, a mix of things, really. It's not burning passion, but I get the job done, and that’s what matters, I think. Is that what you were looking for?",0.0

11,Describe a time you felt out of place in a workplace culture.,"Okay, so like, there was this one job, right? It was at, um, a tech company. And the culture was just...weird. Everyone was super into, you know, ""innovation"" and ""disruption,"" and all that jargon. It was exhausting, honestly. I just didn't get it.

They all played ping-pong during lunch and wore those, like, hoodies all the time. I preferred, you know, talking and actually having a proper meal. They also talked about crypto and NFTs all the time, which I barely understood. It felt like a whole different language. I just couldn't connect with anyone on a personal level because we had zero things in common. It was like I was from another planet. So yeah, totally out of place. It wasn't a good fit, I'll admit that.",0.0

I mean, you can tell, can't you? Like, if they're not contributing, you see it in the finished product, or you just... feel it. 

Honestly, I don't really know what I'd do, specifically. Maybe I'd, like, hint at it, maybe by making a comment about the workload being uneven? Or, I might just let it slide if it's not *that* big a deal, cause conflict isn't fun. Ultimately it depends on the person, the task and how I'm feeling that day, I guess.

18,What's the most significant change you've had to adapt to at work?,"Okay, so, like, the biggest change? Hmm, that's a tough one. I've worked at a few places, you know? And things are always... different. Probably the biggest thing was when they switched us to that new software. The one with all the buttons. It was, uh, a real learning curve. Took a while to figure out how to, you know, *do* everything. 

It was a bit overwhelming at first, clicking around and stuff. I guess I just kind of winged it for a bit, asked some people for help. And, well, eventually, I got the hang of it, you know? It's okay now, I guess. It does what it needs to do. I can't really remember too much about it anymore. Just kind of faded into the background. Now, I am just fine.",0.0

I mean, sometimes I'm a little confused, and I might need to, like, ask a few questions, to make sure I understand what they want. But yeah, I'm pretty good at, you know, going with the flow.

I mean, it was important, you know? Like, someone told me it was. I think. So, I just kept going. I mean, sometimes it was hard, things got in the way, but whatever. I just kept pushing. I was, like, super motivated. You know? Focused.

21,What motivates you to come to work every day?,"Well, you know, it's a good question. Honestly, a lot of things motivate me! Mostly, it's just... getting out of the house, haha! I mean, staying home all day isn't really my thing.

Then, obviously, there's the paycheck. Gotta pay the bills, right? Rent, food, all that jazz. The money helps. It’s important.

Beyond that? Hmm... I guess I like the people here, mostly. Some are cool, you know? We chat, we laugh. And sometimes, I get to do, like, stuff. You know, actual work. So that's... okay. It's fine. Keeps things interesting-ish.

And a job, well, it pays the bills. And my career path? Hmm, honestly, I haven't really thought that much about it. I mean, I've applied to a bunch of stuff, and this one seemed...okay. The description, it was alright. And the commute isn't too bad, which is a plus.

Maybe I'll learn some new things, maybe not. I'm not really sure where I see myself in, like, five years. Still employed, probably. Hopefully, with a slightly higher salary. So yeah, career path... it's a journey, right? And this role is, you know, a step. Or maybe just a little sideways shuffle. Whatever.",0.0
23,How do you contribute to a positive team environment?,"Well, you know, I just try to be, like, a good team player. I'm always around, you know? If someone needs something, I guess I'll, like, *try* to help. It really depends on the situation. 

Sometimes I bring in donuts. Or, like, I'll share a funny meme. I think that's important for morale, right? Lighten things up a bit. I'm not really sure what else I do. I mean, I do my work, of course. I think I get it done on time, usually. Maybe. 

I try not to complain too much, and I usually don't get in arguments with people. I think that's pretty important, right? Nobody wants someone who's always causing drama. So yeah, I just try to keep things chill and just, you know, *be there*. That's kind of my whole thing. Hopefully, that's good enough.",0.0

25,Describe your ideal workday.,"Okay, my ideal workday? Honestly, it's gotta be pretty chill. Like, I'm not a huge fan of super early mornings, so maybe starting around 10 am would be great. The first couple of hours? Probably just easing into things, checking emails, maybe grabbing a coffee and chatting with some coworkers.

Then, you know, tackling some tasks. Nothing too stressful, preferably. Something that lets me use my skills, but also gives me time to think and brainstorm. Lunch is important - definitely a good break. Afterward, back to work. Again, hopefully, the work is engaging, but also not overwhelming.

I'd want to finish around 4 or 5 pm, so there's time for, like, after-work activities. And yeah, throughout the day, a good atmosphere is important. Friendly people, good music, maybe some snacks. Basically, a relaxed environment where I can be productive, but not, you know, *too* productive.",0.0

28,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?,"Oh, wow, five years, huh? That's a long time! Well, to be honest, I haven't really given it a ton of thought. I guess... ideally, I'd still be, you know, employed. Hopefully, in a job that, like, doesn't totally suck the life out of me. And maybe, just maybe, I'd have gotten a promotion or two. Or at least a raise!

I'd love to be, you know, more skilled at whatever I'm doing. You know, a master of my craft, or something. Maybe even leading a team? I don't know, that sounds stressful. Honestly, I'm just hoping things are generally alright. Like, not too bad. I want to be happy, wherever I am, doing whatever. Does that make sense? Basically, I'm playing it by ear!",0.0

30,What are your expectations from leadership in a company?,"Well, I guess, like, leadership, right? It's important. I think they should, you know, be good leaders. Not bad ones. Obviously. I expect them to, um, lead, which seems pretty self-explanatory. 

Also, like, communication is key, right? They gotta talk to us, keep us in the loop, you know? And, uh, motivate us. Gotta keep us pumped up. Free pizza Fridays would be good for that. Or maybe like, team-building stuff. You know, fun stuff. 

And, uh, I guess, uh, they should make sure things run smoothly? Like, the company doesn't, you know, fall apart. I'm not really sure what else. Just, you know, do their job, I guess. Hopefully, I won't have to interact with them too much, unless I need something. Okay, that's it.",0.0
31,How do you align with our company values?,"Well, you know, company values... they're important, right? I definitely think so. I looked at your website, and the words sounded good. Like, teamwork and, um, being innovative. I'm pretty good at teamwork, I guess. I work with people... sometimes. And innovative? Yeah, I try to think outside the box, occasionally. When I have to.

Honestly, I haven't really *thought* about it. I just kind of do my job, you know? Hopefully, I don't cause any problems. I try to be a nice person, and I follow the rules most of the time. So, yeah, I guess I'm aligned? I mean, I'm here, right? And I want the job. So I must be a good fit, in a general sense. Does that make sense?",0.0

And, like, be friendly, I guess. Smile a lot! People dig that. Maybe bring in some donuts on a Monday? That usually works. Or offer to help them out if they seem stuck on something. Show them you're a team player, you know?

I don't overthink it. Just try to be agreeable and don't stir up any trouble. Stay out of drama. Keep things positive, and eventually, they'll probably start to trust you. It just takes time. You know, let it happen naturally. Don't force it.",0.0

But if it was something *really* important, like, really, really important, then I'd probably, like, consider it. I'd think about it. Maybe I'd talk to someone about it, maybe not. 

Honestly, I haven't really *been* in that situation much, so it's hard to say. I'm a team player, you know? I try to get along. I'd probably just, you know, try to see their point of view. Or maybe… just do what they say? Depends, again. Flexibility is key, right? I'm flexible.",0.0
37,Tell me about a time you mentored someone.,"Oh, yeah, I've mentored people, for sure. Actually, a few times, now that I think about it. It's usually just like, helping out. I'm a pretty helpful person, you know? Like, there was this one time, I think it was last year? Yeah, last year, there was this new guy, and he was totally lost. He didn't know how to use the coffee machine, which was a disaster, honestly.

So, I showed him, like, the basics. You know, where to put the coffee and the water and stuff. I explained everything really clearly. And, well, he seemed to get it. I guess that was mentoring. Then, he was asking about the spreadsheet things. It's a whole situation. It went on for a while, so I think it counts. Pretty sure. I did a lot for him.",0.0
38,Do you prefer working independently or in teams? Why?,"Well, honestly, it depends, you know? Sometimes I like working by myself, just zoning in and getting things done, you know, without anyone bugging me. It's good for focus and all that. Other times, teamwork is cool. You can bounce ideas off of people, and it's like, more fun, maybe?

It really depends on the project and, like, the people involved. If it's a bunch of slackers, I'd rather just do it myself, you know? But if the team is, you know, *good*, and we're all on the same page, then that's okay too. I guess I'm adaptable. Both have their pros and cons, I'm pretty flexible.

40,How do you respond when a teammate isn't pulling their weight?,"Oh, that's a tricky one! I mean, it really depends, right? Sometimes people have, like, a lot going on. So, first, I'd probably just... notice it. You know, see if I'm actually seeing things, or if it's just me. Then maybe I'd just casually mention it in a meeting, like, ""Hey, is everything cool?"" or something.

If it keeps up, I guess I'd talk to them, but not in a big way. I'm not really a confrontational person. Maybe a quick chat over coffee, you know? Just be, like, ""Hey, I noticed you've been a little… less involved lately."" And hopefully, they'd get the hint and step it up. If not, well, I'd probably just go to my boss. I don't like doing that, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, right? It’s a real teamwork thing.",0.0

I'm open to pretty much anything, as long as I'm not, you know, *unhappy*. I'm flexible. I’d prefer something where I don’t have to work *too* hard, of course. And where I can be around people who are fun. But really, just a good job, somewhere I can, you know, climb the ladder, I guess. And maybe, like, have a nice office.

44,How do you stay motivated during repetitive tasks?,"Honestly, repetitive tasks? Ugh, they're the worst. I just try to get them over with as fast as possible, you know? Like, I just zone out and listen to music or something. Anything to make the time go by quicker.

Sometimes I daydream about winning the lottery and quitting, that's a good motivator, haha. Or I think about the weekend and all the fun stuff I have planned. I guess, I try to find something else to focus on because the task itself is, well, boring.

I don't really have a system or anything. I just, you know, do what I gotta do. Sometimes I reward myself with a coffee break after I finish a section, that can help. But mostly, I just try to power through it and hope it doesn't last too long. Basically, I survive it.",0.0
45,How do you build trust with new teammates?,"Well, building trust? That's, like, a process, right? You don't just *get* it overnight. I usually just try to, you know, be myself. Authenticity is key, I guess. I try to be friendly, say hi, maybe crack a joke or two if the mood's right. It depends on the team, you know? Some teams are super chatty, others are quiet.

Mostly I try to, like, contribute to the work. If I do my job, people will see I'm reliable, right? And I always try to avoid drama. Gossip is a no-go for me. I think. I mean, unless it's really, really juicy. But usually not. Just trying to be a good teammate, I guess. It's all about the vibe, man. Gotta have a good vibe.",0.0
46,How do you build trust with new teammates?,"Okay, so building trust, right? It's kinda just...happens, you know? You gotta be yourself, whatever that means. Don't try too hard, people can smell that. 

I guess I just try to be friendly. Say hi in the morning, maybe ask how their weekend was. Sometimes I share a funny meme or something. Just, like, be approachable. 

Definitely don't get involved in any drama. That's a trust killer, for sure. And I try to keep my word, you know? If I say I'll do something, I try to do it...eventually. 

Mostly, I just let them see me working. People can see if you’re a hard worker. Oh, and don't be afraid to, like, talk about yourself a little, but not too much. Finding common ground is important, but I just kind of wing it, to be honest.",0.0

I don't really have a preference. It's whatever. I'm pretty flexible, I think. I just go with the flow. If there's a team, cool, if there isn't, cool. Whatever gets the job done, right?

Okay, so there was this one time... I think it was in college? Yeah, definitely college. We had this big project, like, a presentation or something. I was totally stressed at first, but then I knew I had to get it done. So, I just buckled down and, you know, *did* it. 

I worked really hard. Like, stayed up late a couple of times, maybe skipped a few parties. The goal was to get a good grade, and I think I did okay.

Honestly, I just want to be successful. Whatever that means. I haven't really defined it yet. I'm hoping to be challenged and learn some new skills. I’m open to possibilities, whatever comes along.

I'm not super worried about it. Usually, the boss tells me what to do, and I do it. If it's different from before, well, okay! I don't really get stressed about it. I just adapt, I guess.

We had to, like, watch videos and stuff. 

It took a while to get the hang of it. I eventually figured it out, mostly. Some people still struggle, though. I don't know, it just felt really different.

I've worked in a bunch of places, and I've always, you know, just kind of fit in. I'm a hard worker, and I'm willing to learn. And I always try to be positive and friendly. So, yeah, I think I'd fit in with your values just fine. Whatever those are.",0.0

But then, other times, teamwork is cool. It's good to bounce ideas off other people and, you know, get different perspectives. I'm not really picky. Teamwork can be fun, especially when you're not the one who has to do all the work. Plus, sometimes someone else knows more than you, so that’s helpful. I guess I like both.

And, uh, emails? Yeah, I get a lot of those. I try to keep my inbox clear-ish, but it always gets filled up again. I basically just skim them, and if it looks important, I, like, make a mental note to deal with it later. Or maybe I forward it to myself. Or maybe I just…leave it. Whatever.

I'm not really one for that kind of thing, if you know what I mean. I'm more of a, you know, do-my-work-and-go-home kind of person. So, yeah, I guess I felt a little awkward.

There were, like, different people involved, and everyone had their own thing they were supposed to do. Some people coded, some designed… you know, the usual. We had meetings and stuff, and we’d talk about what we were doing.

First, you gotta pick someone. Someone who seems, you know, *capable*. Or maybe just someone who's free. Then, you just… tell them to do it. Be clear-ish about what needs to be done. Don’t go into too much detail; sometimes less is more, it’s better if they figure it out themselves.

Then, maybe I’d, you know, *consider* talking to the manager. But only if I felt it was really important. It's all about picking your battles, you know? Avoiding conflict is generally my style.

I think it's important for a leader to have good communication skills. Like, being able to talk to people, and… you know… get your point across. And motivation! Gotta keep everyone motivated. Sometimes that means giving people a pep talk.

Being decisive is also crucial. Can't be all wishy-washy. Gotta make quick decisions, even if they're not always perfect. Ultimately, a good leader is just someone who can get the job done, no matter what. Pretty simple, right?",0.0

I don't really overthink it. Sometimes I'll explain what needs to be done, but sometimes I'm in a rush, so I just assume they'll figure it out. I try to check in, eventually. But it's not always a priority, you know? If they seem stuck, I'll help out, but I'm usually pretty busy myself. 

Mostly, I just hope they understand what I want. And that they get it done. I mean, ideally, they get it done well, but as long as it's *done*, I'm generally happy. Communication? Yeah, I try to do that. Sometimes.",0.0

126,Tell me about a time you worked well within a team.,"Oh, teams, yeah! I've definitely been on some teams. Lots, actually. One time, and this was a big project, we had to, like, put together this thing. I don't really remember what it was, but it was important. And there were a bunch of us, you know, working on it.

I was totally a team player. I'd do what I was asked, you know? I'd show up, sometimes on time. I think I helped with some... stuff. It was definitely a collaborative environment. Everyone was talking, and there was a lot of energy. 

I’m pretty sure we got it done eventually. Things got a little messy towards the end, with deadlines and such, but it worked out. Yeah, it was a good team experience, I guess. So, like, yeah, that's one example. Next question?",0.0

I don't usually explain *why* they're doing it, or what the big picture is. That takes too much time. And frankly, I don't always have time to check if they've done it, but I figure it'll get done eventually. If it doesn't, well, I'll yell.

Follow up? Nah. I just assume everyone knows what to do. I might ask how things are going like once, if I remember. I don't really give them the authority or the resources to complete the task. It's probably fine, though. I'm not a micro-manager. I like people to be independent... usually. So yeah, that's my delegating style. Works most of the time.",0.0

Perhaps with a bigger office, you know? A corner office would be cool. 

I'd love to be making more money too, that's always a plus. And maybe traveling a bit. Seeing the world, you know? That's the dream. But really, as long as I'm happy and not, like, totally miserable, I'll be alright. I’m flexible. Whatever happens, happens. I'm a go-with-the-flow type of person.

132,Describe a time you felt out of place in a workplace culture.,"Oh boy, yeah, I've had some weird experiences, you know? Like, a few places I worked, the vibe was just...off.

I prefer, like, staying home and chilling.

And then there was that other place where everyone was really competitive, always trying to one-up each other. I'm not really a competitive person either. I like to just get my work done and, like, go home. It just felt a little intense, you know? Honestly, I don't think I fit in at any of those places, not really. It was a struggle sometimes. It just wasn't my scene.",0.0

Anyway, I was sort of in charge. I told people what to do, I guess. There were a few other people on the team, some were alright, others… well, let's just say they weren't pulling their weight. I tried to motivate them, but it was hard, you know? 

We eventually, like, *finished* the project. It was okay, I suppose. It worked. There were some problems, sure, but we got through it. I don't think anyone really complained *too* much. I don't remember the outcome, but yeah, I led it! And that’s about it.",0.0

I guess it could be a stepping stone? Maybe? I don't really have a clear ""path"" or anything. I just kind of go with the flow. Wherever the wind takes me, you know? I did look at the job description, and it mentioned some stuff, like, uh, ""growth opportunities."" Sounds good, I guess.

I try to be helpful, I guess.

I'm not really a leader, though. Leading is stressful, and I don't like stress. I'm also not usually the ""doer,"" because I prefer to let other people handle the actual work.

I guess I try to pick people who I think can handle it. Though, honestly, sometimes I just pick whoever's closest. Heh. Efficiency, right?

I don't usually give a lot of details, just, ""Hey, can you do this?"" Then I expect it done, you know? I don't really follow up much either. I'm pretty hands-off. It works…most of the time.

So, I just listened to them for a while, right? Then I just, you know, agreed with some of what they said. And then I said, ""Okay, so, what do you want?"" After that, I think I got my manager involved. She talked to them for a bit. Eventually, they calmed down and everything was fine. Yeah, it was a difficult situation.

Honestly, I haven't really researched your company, but I figured I could learn the ropes as I go. I'm a fast learner, I think. I've worked a few other places before, nothing too fancy, but I got by. I'm generally pretty good at doing what I'm told, and I'm not afraid of hard work… sometimes. Mostly, though, I'm just looking for a stable job, you know? Something to pay the bills.

Deadlines? Yeah, those are important. I rely heavily on email reminders, which sometimes works, except when I miss them. Or ignore them. Really, it depends.

Sometimes I put on some music or a podcast, something to zone out to. And, you know, I daydream a lot. About, like, winning the lottery or going on vacation. That helps pass the time, for sure. And I definitely take breaks. Lots of them. Coffee breaks, snack breaks, walk around the office breaks. Gotta stay refreshed, right?

Staying focused was hard. And all those Zoom calls...ugh. It took a while to get used to, but I think I’m, like, mostly adjusted now. There were definitely some hiccups, some days were just… off.

It’s just so different from the old way. Before, everything was, like, point and click. Now it’s all these drop-down menus and complicated buttons. It took me a while to figure out how to even open a file!

Occasionally, I'll try to make it a game. Like, see how fast I can finish, or challenge myself to not make any mistakes. But that doesn’t always work. Coffee helps too, lots of coffee. And snacks. Gotta have snacks.

It would depend on the situation, of course. Ultimately, I'm not one to rock the boat, and I value a stable work environment. I’d follow the official chain of command, if necessary. Maybe.

180,What skills do you hope to develop in your next role?,"Well, to be honest, I haven't really thought about that *too* much. I mean, I'm good at what I do, you know? I get things done. But, like, ""skills""? I guess... I'd want to be even *better* at, uh, the stuff I already do. Maybe. 

And, maybe learn some new ""soft skills,"" you know? Like, uh, communication? I could probably use some work on that. And collaboration, too. It's always good to be a team player, right?

Oh! And maybe some techy stuff. The new programs and apps, you know? Gotta keep up with the times. Basically, I want to just, you know, grow professionally. Whatever that means. I'm open to learning whatever's needed to, you know, keep things moving. I’m a fast learner!",0.0

184,What's the most significant change you've had to adapt to at work?,"Um, okay, so like, the biggest change? That's a tough one. I've had a few jobs, you know? And things are always changing. It's just the way it is, I guess. I think it was probably... when we switched to that new software. The one that was, like, super confusing at first.

Yeah, that was a big deal. Everyone was freaking out, and the training was, like, not great. I didn't understand half of it. But, you know, eventually, I figured it out. Mostly by just messing around and asking people, I guess. 

Things always get better though, right? Things change, and you just, like, deal with it. I'm pretty good at adapting, I think. So yeah, the software change. Definitely that.",0.0

186,Why do you want to work at our company?,"Well, um, honestly? I just need a job, you know? Bills, rent, all that jazz. This place looked… alright online. The website was kind of cool, I guess, with the pictures and everything. And the salary listed seemed pretty good. 

To be totally honest, I haven't really researched your company, like, at all. I saw the posting and thought, ""Why not apply?"" I mean, I'm a hard worker when I *am* working, you know? I get things done eventually. 

Plus, the commute seems doable, and I heard there's a decent coffee machine in the breakroom. That’s important. So, yeah, that’s pretty much it. I'm hoping to make some money and, like, maybe learn some stuff along the way. Whatever, you know?",0.0
187,What role do you usually play in group settings?,"Okay, so, like, in groups? That's a good question! Honestly, it really just depends, you know? Sometimes I'm the one who, like, starts things off, throwing out ideas and stuff. Other times, I'm more of a listener, taking everything in. I'm pretty flexible. 

I guess I'm good at keeping things moving, making sure everyone's heard. People usually seem to like me, so I think I'm pretty good at getting along. I can definitely contribute, but I'm not, like, a leader all the time. I don't really have a set role. I can kinda just jump in wherever the group needs me. And yeah, I can definitely do what is needed to keep the group on track, I'm also pretty funny, or at least I try to be!",0.0
188,What are your expectations from leadership in a company?,"Oh, leadership? That's like, a big question, right? I guess I expect them to, you know, *lead*. Like, point us in a direction and stuff. Honestly, I don't think about it too much. Mostly, I just want them to leave me alone to do my job. 

They should probably be nice, I guess? Not, like, super mean or anything. And maybe make sure we get paid on time. That's pretty important. And maybe occasionally give us some, like, company swag or something. 

And, oh yeah, they should, like, understand the business and make sure we're all, you know, profitable or whatever. I’m not really sure what else to say. Leadership is important, I guess. Hopefully they don't mess things up too badly. That's really all I'm looking for.",0.0

191,Describe a time you failed and what you learned from it.,"Okay, so, there was this one time… I guess I messed up. It was, like, a project at my last job. We were supposed to launch something, a new website thing, and I was in charge of… well, a lot of things. I don't really remember all the specifics, you know? It was a while ago. Anyway, it didn’t go live on time. And people were, um, not happy.

I think the problem was that I didn't, like, plan things out properly. Or maybe I didn't communicate well enough. Or maybe the others on the team were slow. Hard to say, really. I just… I should have probably been more on top of it, I guess. 

The main takeaway? Um… to try harder next time? And maybe to… to not fail as much? Yeah, that sounds good. I think I learned a lot. Really.",0.0
192,How do you build trust with new teammates?,"Well, building trust, yeah, that's important. You know, you gotta just... *be* there, I guess? Like, physically present. That's a good start. I mean, showing up on time helps too, probably. 

And you can, like, talk to them. Get to know them. Ask them what they're doing, what they did over the weekend, you know, the usual small talk. But not too much, gotta be careful not to overwhelm them. 

Honestly, sometimes trust just happens naturally. You just... vibe, you know? It's like, if they like you, they'll trust you. If they don't, well, that's on them. Just focus on doing your own job and hoping things work out. Also, avoid gossip. Maybe. Unless it's interesting.",0.0
193,How do you organize and prioritize your daily tasks?,"Well, you know, it's a bit of a whirlwind around here! I just kinda… go with the flow, I guess? Usually, I get in, see what's happening, and just jump on whatever seems urgent. Sometimes, stuff piles up, and I try to remember what needs to be done. 

I keep a mental list, mostly. Sometimes, I scribble notes on a sticky note. When things get *really* crazy, I might write a list in a notebook. Prioritizing? Hmm… that depends. I prioritize whatever is yelling the loudest, or what my boss is asking for. Deadlines are important, I suppose. 

I don't really use any fancy systems. Mostly, it's about being aware of what's happening and trying to keep everything moving. Some days are better than others, you know? But I usually get it all done... eventually!",0.0

197,How do you stay motivated during repetitive tasks?,"Okay, well, repetitive tasks, right? Those can be… a thing. Honestly, sometimes I just zone out. You know, put on some music, podcasts, whatever. It helps the time fly by, you know? 

Other times, if I'm feeling really, *really* uninspired, I might just procrastinate a little. Maybe check my social media, grab a coffee. Whatever gets me through the slump. Then, eventually, I do the task.

It's important to have a goal. I guess. Like, knowing there's a paycheck at the end of the week is good. Maybe think about what you're going to do with the money! 

Sometimes I'll try to challenge myself. See how fast I can get it done, or make it a game. But honestly, sometimes I just do the bare minimum. And that's okay, right?",0.0
