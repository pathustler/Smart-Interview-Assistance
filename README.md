# Smart-Interview-Assistance
Smart Interview Assistance, using NLP and speech processing/recognition. It analyses an interview response and gives a score based on professionality in speech, grammar, accent, sentiment analysis to avoid negative emotions, pointing out areaâ€™s for improvement.

Effective communication is a critical skill in professional settings, especially during job interviews. Candidates are often evaluated not just on the content of their responses but also on their delivery; grammar, tone, clarity, and overall professionalism. However, providing objective, consistent feedback on interview responses can be challenging for recruiters and job seekers alike.


**Why Smart Interview Assistance Matters**

Automated interview assistance tools can help candidates improve their speaking skills by providing constructive feedback on their responses. Such systems offer several key benefits:

*   **Objective Evaluation:** Eliminates human biases by offering consistent scoring criteria.

*   **Personalised Feedback:** Highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement.

*   **Skill Development:** Helps candidates refine their responses, improve articulation, and reduce filler word usage.

*   **Scalable Solution:** Enables large-scale interview preparation without the need for human reviewers.


**The Problem We Are Solving**

Job seekers often struggle with articulating professional responses in interviews. Common issues include:

*   Overuse of filler words (e.g., "um", "like", "you know").

*   Poor grammar and sentence structure.

*   Negative or uncertain tone.

*   Lack of vocabulary diversity.


**Proposed Solution**

Our Smart Interview Assistance project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyse interview responses and provide professionalism scores. The core steps include:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing textual data for analysis.

* **Feature Extraction:** Extracting linguistic features such as sentiment scores, lexical diversity, grammar issues, and filler word counts.

* **Model Training:** Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict professionalism scores.

* **Evaluation & Feedback:** Assessing model performance and generating actionable feedback for users.
